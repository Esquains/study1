Install
=========

There are two ways to install functorch:
1. functorch main
2. functorch preview with PyTorch 1.10

We recommend installing functorch main development branch for the latest and
greatest. This requires an installation of the latest PyTorch nightly.

If you're looking for an older version of functorch that works with a stable
version of PyTorch (1.10), please install the functorch preview.

Check out `the instructions at our GitHub <https://github.com/pytorch/functorch/blob/main/README.md#install>`_.
