# TODO: Figure out a way to pin this dependency. At the moment, it could
# not be pinned because cross-compiling arm64 from x86-64 picks up 1.40.0
# while testing on arm64 itself only has up to 1.39.0 from upstream conda.
# Thus, pinning the version to either leads to a conda package conflict.
# Both versions work though, so it's ok to keep it like this.
