# pytorch/.github

This directory contains workflows and scripts to support our CI infrastructure that runs on Github Actions.


## Workflows / Templates

Our current Github Actions setup uses templates written in [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) that are located in the
`.github/templates` directory to generate workflow files found in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

These templates contain a couple of utility templates used to discern common utilities that can be
used amongst different templates.

### (Re)Generating workflow files

You will need `jinja2` in order to regenerate the workflow files which can be installed using:
```bash
pip install -r .github/requirements.txt
```

Workflows can be generated / regenerated using the following command:
```bash
.github/regenerate.sh
```

### Adding a new generated workflow

New generated workflows can be added in the `.github/scripts/generate_ci_workflows.py` script. You can reference
examples from that script in order to add the workflow to the stream that is relevant to what you particularly
care about.

Different parameters can be used to acheive different goals, i.e. running jobs on a cron, running only on trunk, etc.

#### ciflow (specific)

ciflow is the way we can get `non-default` workflows to run on specific PRs. Within the `generate_ci_workflows.py` script
you will notice a multitude of `LABEL_CIFLOW_<NAME>` variables which correspond to labels on Github. Workflows that
do not run on ``LABEL_CIFLOW_DEFAULT` can be triggered on PRs by applying the label found in `generate_ci_workflows.py`

Example:
```python
    CIWorkflow(
        arch="linux",
        build_environment="periodic-linux-xenial-cuda10.2-py3-gcc7-slow-gradcheck",
        docker_image_base=f"{DOCKER_REGISTRY}/pytorch/pytorch-linux-xenial-cuda10.2-cudnn7-py3-gcc7",
        test_runner_type=LINUX_CUDA_TEST_RUNNER,
        num_test_shards=2,
        distributed_test=False,
        timeout_after=360,
        # Only run this on master 4 times per day since it does take a while
        is_scheduled="0 */4 * * *",
        ciflow_config=CIFlowConfig(
            labels={LABEL_CIFLOW_LINUX, LABEL_CIFLOW_CUDA, LABEL_CIFLOW_SLOW_GRADCHECK, LABEL_CIFLOW_SLOW, LABEL_CIFLOW_SCHEDULED},
        ),
    ),
```

This workflow does not get triggered by default since it does not contain the `LABEL_CIFLOW_DEFAULT` label in its CIFlowConfig but applying
the `LABEL_CIFLOW_SLOW_GRADCHECK` on your PR will trigger this specific workflow to run.

#### ciflow (trunk)

The label `ciflow/trunk` can be used to run `trunk` only workflows. This is especially useful if trying to re-land a PR that was
reverted for failing a `non-default` workflow.

## Infra

Currently most of our self hosted runners are hosted on AWS, for a comprehensive list of available runner types you
can reference `.github/scale-config.yml`.

Exceptions to AWS for self hosted:
* ROCM runners

### Adding new runner types

New runner types can be added by committing changes to `.github/scale-config.yml`. Example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/70474

> NOTE: New runner types can only be used once the changes to `.github/scale-config.yml` have made their way into the default branch
