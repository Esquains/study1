class Dropout(Module):
    r"""During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input
    tensor with probability *p* using samples from a bernoulli distribution.
    The elements to zero are randomized on every forward call.

    This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and
    preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper
    `Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature
    detectors`_ .

    Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of :math:`\frac{1}{1-p}` during
    training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5

class AlphaDropout(Module):
    r"""Applies Alpha Dropout over the input.

    Alpha Dropout is a type of Dropout that maintains the self-normalizing
    property.
    For an input with zero mean and unit standard deviation, the output of
    Alpha Dropout maintains the original mean and standard deviation of the
    input.
    Alpha Dropout goes hand-in-hand with SELU activation function, which ensures
    that the outputs have zero mean and unit standard deviation.

    During training, it randomly masks some of the elements of the input
    tensor with probability *p* using samples from a bernoulli distribution.
    The elements to masked are randomized on every forward call, and scaled
    and shifted to maintain zero mean and unit standard deviation.

    During evaluation the module simply computes an identity function.

    More details can be found in the paper `Self-Normalizing Neural Networks`_ .

    Args:
        p (float): probability of an element to be dropped. Default: 0.5

    Shape:
        - Input: `Any`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: `Same`. Output is of the same shape as input

class Zoneout(Module):
    r"""During training of an RNN, randomly swaps some of the elements of the
    input tensor with its values from a previous time-step with probability *p*
    using samples from a Bernoulli distribution. The elements to be swapped are
    randomized on every time-step by default, but a shared mask can be
    provided.

    Zoneout is a variant of dropout designed specifically for regularizing
    recurrent connections of LSTMs or GRUs. While dropout applies a zero mask
    to its inputs, zoneout applies an identity mask when incrementing a
    time-step.

    It has proven to be an effective technique for regularization of LSTMs
    and GRUs as, contrary to dropout, gradient information and state
    information are more readily propagated through time. For further
    information, consult the paper
    `Zoneout: Regularizing RNNs by Randomly Preserving Hidden Activation`_ .

    Similarly to dropout, during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Args:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: None.
        inplace: If set to ``True``, will do this operation in-place.
        Default: ``False``
        mask: `ByteTensor`. A mask used to select elements to be swapped.
        The intended use case for this argument is sharing a zoneout mask
        across several time-steps.

    Shape:
        - Input: `Any`. A pair of tensors of the same shape
        - Output: `Same`. Output is of the same shape as input

    Examples::

        >>> zoneout = nn.Zoneout(p=0.15)
        >>> current_hidden_state = Variable(torch.Tensor([1, 2, 3]))
        >>> previous_hidden_state = Variable(torch.Tensor([4, 5, 6]))
        >>> output = zoneout(current_hidden_state, previous_hidden_state)

    Using a shared mask:
        >>> mask = torch.ByteTensor(1, 3).bernoulli()
        >>> zoneout = nn.Zoneout(mask=mask)
        >>> current_hidden_state = Variable(torch.Tensor([1, 2, 3]))
        >>> previous_hidden_state = Variable(torch.Tensor([4, 5, 6]))
        >>> output = zoneout(current_hidden_state, previous_hidden_state)

    Wrapping around a `GRUCell`:
        >>> rnn = nn.GRUCell(10, 20)
        >>> input = Variable(torch.randn(6, 3, 10))
        >>> h = Variable(torch.randn(3, 20))
        >>> h_prev = Variable(torch.randn(3, 20))
        >>> output = []
        >>> for i in range(6):
