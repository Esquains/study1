    r"""This function implements parallelized and scaled dot product attention with an arbitrary attention score modification function.

    This function computes the parallelized scaled dot product attention between query, key, and value tensors with a user-defined
    attention score modification function. The attention score modification function will be applied after the attention
    scores have been calculated between the query and key tensors. The attention scores are calculated as follows:

    The ``score_mod`` function should have the following signature:

    .. code-block:: python

        def score_mod(
            score: torch.Tensor,
            batch: torch.Tensor,
            head: torch.Tensor,
            token_q: torch.Tensor,
            token_kv: torch.Tensor
        ) -> torch.Tensor:

    Where:
        - ``score``: A scalar tensor representing the attention score,
          with the same data type and device as the query, key, and value tensors.
        - ``batch``, ``head``, ``token_q``, ``token_kv``: Scalar tensors indicating
          the batch index, head index, query index, and key/value index, respectively.
          These should have the ``torch.int`` data type and be located on the same device as the score tensor.

    Args:
        query (Tensor): Query tensor; shape :math:`(B, H, L, E)`.
        key (Tensor): Key tensor; shape :math:`(B, H, S, E)`.
        value (Tensor): Value tensor; shape :math:`(B, H, S, Ev)`.
        score_mod (Callable): Function to modify attention scores

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): Attention output; shape :math:`(B, H, L, Ev)`.

    Shape legend:
        - :math:`N: \text{Batch size} ... : \text{Any number of other batch dimensions (optional)}`
        - :math:`S: \text{Source sequence length}`
        - :math:`L: \text{Target sequence length}`
        - :math:`E: \text{Embedding dimension of the query and key}`
        - :math:`Ev: \text{Embedding dimension of the value}`

    .. warning::
        `torch.nn.attention.flex_decoder` is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It doesn't support training currently.
        Please look forward to a more stable implementation in a future version of PyTorch.
