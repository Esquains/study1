    r"""
    Modifies the given ``hook`` to overlap the :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`
    optimizer step with the :class:`DistributedDataParallel` backward pass,
    where the optimizer step computation begins after the last gradient bucket
    computation has finished.

    This approach overlaps the optimizer computation and communication with the
    backward communication. In particular, the backward computation proceeds
    contiguously, and the optimizer computation follows, overlapping with
    outstanding backward communication (i.e. all-reduces) and possibly other
    optimizer communication (i.e. broadcasts).

    This approach may be preferred over :meth:`hook_with_zero_step_interleaved`
    if communication is relatively slow compared to computation.

    Arguments:
        hook (Callable[[Any, dist.GradBucket], torch.futures.Future]): the hook
            to modify.
        ddp (DistributedDataParallel): the :class:`DistributedDataParallel`
            instance to use.
        zero (ZeroRedundancyOptimizer): the :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`
            instance to use.

    Returns:
        The modified hook.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``zero`` was constructed with ``overlap_with_ddp=False``.
        RuntimeError: if using any backend other than NCCL since currently
            Gloo may hang.

    .. warning::
        Given the way that overlapping :class:`DistributedDataParallel` with
        :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` is currently implemented, the first
        two training iterations do not perform parameter updates in the
        optimizer step. This is because it needs information about the gradient
        bucketing strategy used by :class:`DistributedDataParallel`, which is
        not finalized until the second forward pass.
