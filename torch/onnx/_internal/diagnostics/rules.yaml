# PyTorch ONNX Exporter (POE) Rules are based on sarif ReportingDescriptor format.

# TODO: Define additional format requirements on top of sarif for our usage.
#       For example: pre defined keys for message_strings for logging on different levels.
# TODO: Based on above, create helper script to generate new rules.
# TODO: Separate rules into individual files.
# TODO: These rules are for demonstration purposes only. They are not complete.

      Node is missing ONNX shape inference.
      This usually happens when the node is not valid under standard ONNX operator spec.
  message_strings:
    default:
      text: "The shape inference of {0} type is missing, so it may result in wrong shape inference for the exported graph.
      Please consider adding it in symbolic function."

    text: RNN operation has no initial states input and variable batch size. Export with batch size set to 1.
  full_description:
    text: ""
    markdown: |
      The RNN code in pytorch accepts an optional hidden state. When it is not provided,
      it is default-initialized by constructing a new Variable, which gets traced as a
      ConstantOfShape with the expected Shape. When initial_states, h0 and c0 are
      specified but are not inputs of the model (they are Constants) and the batch size
      is variable, the model should be saved with a batch size of 1 (or an error will
      occur), and we save the value of h0 and c0 with a batch size of 1. When the model
      is then called with a different batch size value, h0 and c0 are broadcasted to
      get the right shape.
  message_strings:
    default:
      text: "Exporting the operator '{0}' to ONNX opset version {1} is not supported when
      batch size is variable. Export with batch size set to 1"
