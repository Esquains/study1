    object for later replay.

    See :ref:`CUDA Graphs <cuda-graph-semantics>` for a general introduction,
    detailed use, and constraints.

    Arguments:
        cuda_graph (torch.cuda.CUDAGraph): Graph object used for capture.
        pool (optional): Opaque token (returned by a call to :func:`~torch.cuda.graph_pool_handle()` or
            :meth:`other_Graph_instance.pool()<torch.cuda.CUDAGraph.pool>`) hinting this graph's capture
            may share memory from the specified pool. See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>`.
        stream (torch.cuda.Stream, optional): If supplied, will be set as the current ambient stream in the context.
            If not supplied, ``Graph`` sets its own internal side stream as the ambient stream in the context.

    .. note::
        For effective memory sharing, if you pass a ``pool`` used by a previous capture and the previous capture
        used an explicit ``stream`` argument, you should pass the same ``stream`` argument to this capture.

    Accepts callables (functions or :class:`nn.Module<torch.nn.Module>`\ s)
    and returns graphed versions.

    Each graphed callable's forward pass runs its source callable's
    forward CUDA work as a CUDA graph inside a single autograd node.

    If ``autograd_aware`` is True, the graphed callable's forward pass also appends
    a backward node to the autograd graph. During backward, this node runs the
    callable's backward work as a CUDA graph.

    Therefore, each graphed callable should be a drop-in replacement for its source callable
    in an autograd-enabled training loop.

    See :ref:`Partial-network capture<partial-network-capture>` for detailed use and constraints.

    .. note::
        The ``requires_grad`` state of each Tensor in ``sample_inputs`` must match the state
        that's expected for the corresponding real input in the training loop.
