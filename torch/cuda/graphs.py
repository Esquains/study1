    Arguments:

            may share memory from the specified pool. See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>`.
        stream (torch.cuda.Stream, optional): If supplied, will be set as the current stream in the context.
            If not supplied, ``graph`` sets its own internal side stream as the current stream in the context.

    .. note::
        For effective memory sharing, if you pass a ``pool`` used by a previous capture and the previous capture
        used an explicit ``stream`` argument, you should pass the same ``stream`` argument to this capture.

    .. warning
        This API is a prototype and may change in future releases.

    Accepts callables (functions or :class:`nn.Module<torch.nn.Module>`\ s)
    and returns graphed versions.

    Each graphed callable's forward pass runs its source callable's
    forward CUDA work as a CUDA graph inside a single autograd node.

    The graphed callable's forward pass also appends
    a backward node to the autograd graph. During backward, this node runs the
    callable's backward work as a CUDA graph.

    Therefore, each graphed callable should be a drop-in replacement for its source callable
    in an autograd-enabled training loop.

    See :ref:`Partial-network capture<partial-network-capture>` for detailed use and constraints.

    If you pass a tuple of several callables, their captures will use the same memory pool.
    See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when this is appropriate.

    Arguments:
        callables (torch.nn.Module or Python function, or tuple of these): Callable or callables to graph.
            See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>` for when passing a tuple of callables
            is appropriate.  If you pass a tuple of callables, their order in the tuple must be the same order
            they'll run in the live workload.
        sample_args (tuple of Tensors, or tuple of tuples of Tensors): Samples args for each callable.
            If a single callable was passed, ``sample_args`` must be a single tuple of argument Tensors.
            If a tuple of callables was passed, ``sample_args`` must be tuple of tuples of argument Tensors.

    .. note::
        The ``requires_grad`` state of each Tensor in ``sample_args`` must match the state
        that's expected for the corresponding real input in the training loop.

    .. warning::
        ``sample_args`` for each callable must be a tuple of Tensors. Other types and keyword args
        are not allowed.

    .. warning::
        Returned callables do not support higher order differentiation (e.g., double backward).

    .. warning::
        After you pass a :class:`torch.nn.Module` through :func:`~make_graphed_callables`,
        you may not add or remove any of that Module's parameters or buffers.

    .. warning::
        :class:`torch.nn.Module`\s passed to :func:`~torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables` must not have module hooks
        registered on them at the time they are passed. However, registering hooks on modules *after* passing them
        through :func:`~torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables` is allowed.

    .. warning::
        When running a graphed callable, you must pass its arguments in the same order and format
        they appeared in that callable's ``sample_args``.

    .. warning::
        All Tensor outputs of graphed callables must require grad.
