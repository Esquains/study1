Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

-  **How can I contribute as a reviewer?** There is lots of value if
   community developer reproduce issues, try out new functionality, or
   otherwise help us identify or troubleshoot issues. Commenting on
   tasks or pull requests with your environment details is helpful and
   appreciated.
-  **CI tests failed, what does it mean?** Maybe you need to merge with
   master or rebase with latest changes. Pushing your changes should
   re-trigger CI tests. If the tests persist, you'll want to trace
   through the error messages and resolve the related issues.
-  **What are the most high risk changes?** Anything that touches build
   configuration is an risky area. Please avoid changing these unless
   you've had a discussion with the team beforehand.
-  **Hey, a commit showed up on my branch, what's up with that?**
   Sometimes another community member will provide a patch or fix to
   your pull request or branch. This is often needed for getting CI tests
   to pass.
