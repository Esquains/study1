Getting Started
---------------

Proposing new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New feature ideas are best discussed on a specific issue. Please include
as much information as you can, any accompanying data, and your proposed
solution. The PyTorch team and community frequently reviews new issues
and comments where they think they can help. If you feel confident in
your solution, go ahead and implement it.

Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've identified an issue, first search through the `list of
existing issues <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues>`__ on the
repo. If you are unable to find a similar issue, then create a new one.
Supply as much information you can to reproduce the problematic
behavior. Also, include any additional insights like the behavior you
expect.

Implementing Features or Fixing Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to fix a specific issue, it's best to comment on the
individual issue with your intent. However, we do not lock or assign
issues except in cases where we have worked with the developer before.
It's best to strike up a conversation on the issue and discuss your
proposed solution. The PyTorch team can provide guidance that saves you
time.

Issues that are labeled first-new-issue, low, or medium priority provide
the best entrance point are great places to start.

Adding Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A great deal of the tutorials on `pytorch.org <https://pytorch.org/>`__
come from the community itself and we welcome additional contributions.
To learn more about how to contribute a new tutorial you can learn more
here: `PyTorch.org Tutorial Contribution Guide on
Github <https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/#contributing>`__

Improving Documentation & Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We aim to produce high quality documentation and tutorials. On rare
occasions that content includes typos or bugs. If you find something you
can fix, send us a pull request for consideration.

Take a look at the `Documentation <#on-documentation>`__ section to learn how our system
works.

Participating in online discussions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find active discussions happening on the PyTorch Discussion
`forum <https://discuss.pytorch.org/>`__.

Submitting pull requests to fix open issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view a list of all open issues
`here <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues>`__. Commenting on an
issue is a great way to get the attention of the team. From here you can
share your ideas and how you plan to resolve the issue.

For more challenging issues, the team will provide feedback and
direction for how to best solve the issue.

If you're not able to fix the issue itself, commenting and sharing
whether you can reproduce the issue can be useful for helping the team
identify problem areas.

If you do issue a pull request, make sure it has a test that fails before and
passes after the new code, either by modifying an existing test or by adding a
new one. See `how-to-run-tests` for information on running tests locally.

Reviewing open pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We appreciate your help reviewing and commenting on pull requests. Our
team strives to keep the number of open pull requests at a manageable
size, we respond quickly for more information if we need it, and we
merge PRs that we think are useful. However, due to the high level of
interest, additional eyes on pull requests is appreciated.

Improving code readability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improve code readability helps everyone. It is often better to submit a
small number of pull requests that touch few files versus a large pull
request that touches many files. Starting a discussion in the PyTorch
forum `here <https://discuss.pytorch.org/>`__ or on an issue related to
your improvement is the best way to get started.

Adding test cases to make the codebase more robust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional test coverage is appreciated.

Promoting PyTorch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of PyTorch in your projects, research papers, write ups, blogs,
or general discussions around the internet helps to raise awareness for
PyTorch and our growing community. Please reach out to
`pytorch-marketing@fb.com <http://mailto:pytorch-marketing@fb.com/>`__
for marketing support.

Triaging issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you feel that an issue could benefit from a particular tag or level
of complexity comment on the issue and share your opinion. If an you
feel an issue isn't categorized properly comment and let the team know.
