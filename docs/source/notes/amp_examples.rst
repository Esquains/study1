Gradient Scaling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gradient scaling helps prevent gradient underflow when training with mixed precision,
as explained :ref:`here<gradient-scaling>`.

Instances of :class:`torch.cuda.amp.AmpScaler` help perform the steps of
gradient scaling conveniently, as shown in the following code snippets.


Typical Use
-----------

::

    # Create an AmpScaler instance.
    scaler = AmpScaler()
    ...
    for input, target in data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(input)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)

        # Scale the loss, and call backward() on the scaled loss to create scaled gradients.
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()

        # scaler.step() first unscales the gradients of the optimizer's assigned params.
        # If these gradients do not contain infs or NaNs, optimizer.step() is then called,
        # otherwise, optimizer.step() is skipped.
        scaler.step(optimizer)

        # Update the scale for next iteration.
        scaler.update()

Working with Unscaled Gradients
-------------------------------

All gradients produced by ``scaler.scale(loss).backward()`` are scaled.  If you wish to modify or inspect
the parameters' ``.grad`` attributes between ``backward()`` and ``scaler.step(optimizer)``,  you should
unscale them first.  For example, gradient clipping manipulates a set of gradients such that their global norm
(see :func:`torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`) or maximum magnitude (see :func:`torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value_`)
is :math:`<=` some user-imposed threshold.  If you attempted to clip _without_ unscaling, the gradients' norm/maximum
magnitude would also be scaled, so your requested threshold (which was meant to be the threshold for _unscaled_ gradients)
would be invalid.

``scaler.unscale(optimizer)`` unscales gradients held by ``optimizer``'s assigned parameters.
If your model or models contain other parameters that were assigned to another optimizer
(say ``optimizer1``), you may call ``scaler.unscale(optimizer1)`` separately to unscale those
parameters' gradients as well.

Gradient clipping
"""""""""""""""""

Calling ``scaler.unscale(optimizer)`` before clipping enables you to clip unscaled gradients as usual::

    scaler = AmpScaler()
    ...
    for input, target in data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(input)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()

        # Unscale the gradients of optimizer's assigned params in-place
        scaler.unscale(optimizer)

        # Since the gradients of optimizer's assigned params are unscaled, clip as usual:
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm)

        # optimizer's gradients are already unscaled, so scaler.step does not unscale them,
        # although it still skips optimizer.step() if the gradients contain infs or NaNs.
        scaler.step(optimizer)

        # Update the scale for next iteration.
        scaler.update()

``scaler`` records that ``scaler.unscale(optimizer)`` was already called for this optimizer
this iteration, so ``scaler.step(optimizer)`` knows not to redundantly unscale gradients before
(internally) calling ``optimizer.step()``.

.. warning::
    :meth:`unscale` should only be called once per optimizer per :meth:`step` call,
    and only after all gradients for that optimizer's assigned parameters have been accumulated.
    Calling unscale twice for a given optimizer between :meth:`step`\ s triggers a RuntimeError.

Working with Scaled Gradients
-----------------------------

For some operations, you may need to work with scaled gradients in a setting where
``scaler.unscale`` is unsuitable.

Gradient penalty
""""""""""""""""

A gradient penalty implementation typically creates gradients out-of-place using
:func:`torch.autograd.grad`, combines them to create the penalty scalar,
and adds the penalty scalar to the loss.

Here's an ordinary example of an L2 penalty without gradient scaling::

    for input, target in data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(input)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)

        # Create some gradients out-of-place
        grad_params = torch.autograd.grad(loss, model.parameters(), create_graph=True)

        # Compute the penalty term and add it to the loss
        grad_norm = 0
        for grad in grad_params:
            grad_norm += grad.pow(2).sum()
        grad_norm = grad_norm.sqrt()
        loss = loss + grad_norm

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

To implement a gradient penalty _with_ gradient scaling, the loss passed to
:func:`torch.autograd.grad` should be scaled.  The resulting out-of-place gradients
will therefore be scaled, and should be unscaled before being combined to create the
penalty scalar.

Here's how that looks for the same L2 penalty::

    scaler = AmpScaler()
    ...
    for input, target in data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(input)
        loss = loss_fn(output, target)

        # Scale the loss for the out-of-place backward pass, resulting in scaled grad_params
        scaled_grad_params = torch.autograd.grad(scaler.scale(loss), model.parameters(), create_graph=True)

        # Unscale grad_params before computing the penalty.  grad_params are not owned
        # by any optimizer, so use ordinary ops instead of scaler.unscale:
        inv_scale = 1./scaler.get_scale()
        grad_params = [p*inv_scale for p in scaled_grad_params]

        # Compute the penalty term and add it to the loss
        grad_norm = 0
        for grad in grad_params:
            grad_norm += grad.pow(2).sum()
        grad_norm = grad_norm.sqrt()
        loss = loss + grad_norm

        # Apply scaling to the backward call as usual.  This accumulates leaf gradients that are appropriately scaled.
        scaler.scale(loss).backward()
        scaler.step(optimizer)
        scaler.update()


Working with Multiple Losses and Optimizers
-------------------------------------------

If your network has multiple losses, you must call ``scaler.scale`` on each of them individually.
If your network has multiple optimizers, you may call ``scaler.unscale`` on any of them individually,
and you must call ``scaler.step`` on each of them individually.

However, ``scaler.update()`` should only be called once,
after all optimizers used in this iteration have been stepped::

    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.AmpScaler()
    ...
    for input, target in data:
        optimizer0.zero_grad()
        optimizer1.zero_grad()
        output0 = model0(input)
        output1 = model1(input)
        loss0 = loss_fn(2 * output0 + 3 * output1, target)
        loss1 = loss_fn(3 * output0 - 5 * output1, target)

        scaler.scale(loss0).backward(retain_graph=True)
        scaler.scale(loss1).backward()

        # You can choose which optimizers receive explicit unscaling, if you
        # want to inspect or modify the gradients of the params they own.
        scaler.unscale(optimizer0)

        scaler.step(optimizer0)
        scaler.step(optimizer1)

        scaler.update()

Each optimizer independently checks its gradients for infs/NaNs, and therefore makes an independent decision
whether or not to skip the step.  This may result in one optimizer skipping the step
while the other one does not.  Since step skipping occurs rarely (every several hundred iterations)
this should not impede convergence.  If you observe poor convergence after adding gradient scaling
to a multiple-optimizer model, please file an issue.
